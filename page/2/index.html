		<p><span class="disclaimer"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Commentary on the latest fad to get riled up about isn't my thing, but I wanted to elaborate on my <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya/status/191856633066958848">miniphany</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Maybe it will lead to a better workflow for people who are looking for a solution to come to them rather than them solving it themselves.<span></p>
<p>I ran into <a href="http://joncalhoun.posterous.com/email-sucks-this-is-how-we-fix-it">this rant about e-mail</a> while link-jumping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is integrated with my email, yet it is my primary source of communication. What the hell? I shouldn't have to forward an email to accounting and then follow up to make sure they handled it. I shouldn't need to lookup the original email for a feature request - it should be integrated into the request itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I took it seriously is because he's actually taken the initiative and is <a href="http://www.roockit.com/">trying to solve the problem</a>. Although I do think it's a waste of his time because he has misunderstood the problem.</p>
<p>E-mail is probably a bad name for what it actually does when you look at the protocol used to implement it. It's got nothing to do with "mail" in the traditional sense. What e-mail is, is an extensible and powerful notification system. It's job is to ping you and alert you to something that needs your attention, then get out of your way. It's a different issue altogether that we use it for communication, because it's a carry over from the older web when the requirements of communication were simpler. For some reason, people like <a href="http://joncalhoun.posterous.com/email-sucks-this-is-how-we-fix-it">joncalhoun</a> and even <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">Paul Graham</a> have forgotten or misunderstood what e-mail was, in the sense that they want e-mail to <em>work</em> for them. It's like how someone got tweets to operate lights and fans in their house. It's the client's/application's problem, not the protocol's.</p>
<p>If you want issue tracking or calendaring, or even a to-do list, you go to an issue tracker, a calendar or a to-do list app. What e-mail does is notify you when something changes in those apps. It is up to <em>those</em> apps — not e-mail — to build the social stuff you're looking for. Github sends me an e-mail whenever someone adds an issue to my repositories, and I click through to manage it there. It doesn't make sense to have that functionality built into my e-mail client. If you don't use a dedicated issue-tracker for your bugs, you're doing it wrong. Could an e-mail client be written to handle different types of messages? Send a bug to your issue tracker, or send a to-do item to your to-do app? Sure. But that's not something that needs to be added to the protocol.</p>
<p>So here's the oft repeated statement, slightly tweaked: E-mail is not broken, your workflow is.</p>

		<p>Interesting IDE concept, especially the 'smallest unit of code is a function' part. Now add Vim keybindings (because it's still the fastest way to move around text, regardless of what you say) and support for the most popular languages to this and we have something awesome.</p>

		<p>The reason the Internet works is because it's interconnected. More than just hyperlinks pointing to things, websites can <em>talk</em> to each other and present context-specific information that they themselves don't necessarily contain, e.g. which of your friends like a website via. the Facebook "Like" button. Best of all, everything is distributed.</p>
<p>Why, then, do applications on our computers behave like silos?</p>
<p>Why doesn't my feed reader know my browser history (so that it can tell me if I've already read an article)? Why doesn't my browser know that I've already downloaded the file I'm trying to download now? Why doesn't my text editor know which email the document I'm currently editing was attached to?</p>
<p>The obvious way to solve this problem would be to do what we do on the web: allow individual applications to expose APIs that other applications can call to get more information. The not so obvious are things like avoiding duplication (something even the web struggles with, which if you've ever joined more than one social network, you've faced). But we could start small, like apps being able to query application specific information about things — like Reeder being able to ask Chrome if I've already visited the link pointed to by the article I'm reading.</p>
<p>I don't know, this seems like a problem we would have at least tried to solve, but I don't think OS' even support anything that might allow this. The most interoperability I've seen is registering application specific protocols so that when I open a <code>itunes://</code> link in Chrome, it opens in iTunes. I suppose it was cool in 2008, but four years later that's still all we have.</p>

		<blockquote>
<p>... [O]ne of the main things an orchestra conductor does is to prepare the orchestra in rehearsal for the way he/she wants the piece to sound in performance. A lot of stuff is conveyed in that way that the conductor then won't need to attempt to convey in real time during the performance. And furthermore, as you suspect, conductors are often in some sense kind of "dancing" for the audience during performances, in ways that are strictly superfluous to making the musicians play correctly, though sometimes an enjoyable part of the concert experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the musicians don't need much help keeping time, so the patterns are either heavily modified or abandoned entirely-although you can often see downbeats and things if you look for them. Second, orchestral conductors conduct WAY ahead of the beat the musicians are actually playing. This helps the musicians respond in real time to the conductor's instructions. From the audience's perspective, therefore, it can be nearly impossible to see the connection between what the conductor is doing and what you're hearing from the musicians-they're probably substantially out of sync.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered about the same thing, and I suppose kind-of knew that there is a lot less of realtime-ness in what a conductor does and more about the rehearsals. Once you practice everything hundreds of times, you don't really need someone guiding you.</p>
