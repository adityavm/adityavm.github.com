<p>I would pay good money to buy his sketchbook(s?) and keep it in a glass case.</p>]]></description>

					<title>Light Table</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>Interesting IDE concept, especially the 'smallest unit of code is a function' part. Now add Vim keybindings (because it's still the fastest way to move around text, regardless of what you say) and support for the most popular languages to this and we have something awesome.</p>]]></description>

					<title>Application Silos</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>The reason the Internet works is because it's interconnected. More than just hyperlinks pointing to things, websites can <em>talk</em> to each other and present context-specific information that they themselves don't necessarily contain, e.g. which of your friends like a website via. the Facebook "Like" button. Best of all, everything is distributed.</p>
<p>Why, then, do applications on our computers behave like silos?</p>
<p>Why doesn't my feed reader know my browser history (so that it can tell me if I've already read an article)? Why doesn't my browser know that I've already downloaded the file I'm trying to download now? Why doesn't my text editor know which email the document I'm currently editing was attached to?</p>
<p>The obvious way to solve this problem would be to do what we do on the web: allow individual applications to expose APIs that other applications can call to get more information. The not so obvious are things like avoiding duplication (something even the web struggles with, which if you've ever joined more than one social network, you've faced). But we could start small, like apps being able to query application specific information about things — like Reeder being able to ask Chrome if I've already visited the link pointed to by the article I'm reading.</p>
<p>I don't know, this seems like a problem we would have at least tried to solve, but I don't think OS' even support anything that might allow this. The most interoperability I've seen is registering application specific protocols so that when I open a <code>itunes://</code> link in Chrome, it opens in iTunes. I suppose it was cool in 2008, but four years later that's still all we have.</p>]]></description>

					<title>What Does a Music Conductor Do?</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>... [O]ne of the main things an orchestra conductor does is to prepare the orchestra in rehearsal for the way he/she wants the piece to sound in performance. A lot of stuff is conveyed in that way that the conductor then won't need to attempt to convey in real time during the performance. And furthermore, as you suspect, conductors are often in some sense kind of "dancing" for the audience during performances, in ways that are strictly superfluous to making the musicians play correctly, though sometimes an enjoyable part of the concert experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the musicians don't need much help keeping time, so the patterns are either heavily modified or abandoned entirely-although you can often see downbeats and things if you look for them. Second, orchestral conductors conduct WAY ahead of the beat the musicians are actually playing. This helps the musicians respond in real time to the conductor's instructions. From the audience's perspective, therefore, it can be nearly impossible to see the connection between what the conductor is doing and what you're hearing from the musicians-they're probably substantially out of sync.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered about the same thing, and I suppose kind-of knew that there is a lot less of realtime-ness in what a conductor does and more about the rehearsals. Once you practice everything hundreds of times, you don't really need someone guiding you.</p>]]></description>

					<title>On What People Want</title>

<p>People don’t know what they want until you’ve given it to them.</p>
<p>And then they don’t know what they want next: they think it’s more of what they liked last time.</p>
