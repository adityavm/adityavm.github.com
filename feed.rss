					<title>Github Octicons</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>These are absolutely gorgeous. Congratulations to Github on coming up with a rather interesting and <a href="https://github.com/blog/1135-the-making-of-octicons">well implemented</a> solution to their problem. With the state of displays being in flux as it is today, it makes sense to offload the rendering to the OS as much as possible, effectively future proofing another aspect of their website.</p>
<p>While this might not be a solution for most of us, it seems like the best way to distribute icons (and <a href="https://github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark">glyphs</a> in general) that scale well across all resolutions and sizes. Maybe we should start thinking differently about what constitutes a "font", and expand on how we use them beyond the alphanumeric symbols.</p>]]></description>

<p>If your work is filled with the hope and longing for applause, it's no longer your work — the dependence on approval has corrupted it, turned it into a process where you are striving for ever more approval.</p>

					<title>Github Notifier</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I'm watching more repositories on Github than I'm following people on Twitter.What does that tell you?</p>— Aditya Mukherjee (@aditya) <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya/status/190033805782949888" data-datetime="2012-04-11T11:09:24+00:00">April 11, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I watch repositories in Github like I follow people on Twitter; I do it because I'm (very) interested in its present status and want to keep an out on its future development. I know most people use it like a bookmark for repos they want to come look at later, but I don't (I use <em>real</em> bookmarks for that).</p>
<p>But now that I've started watching a lot of repos (22, which includes beasts like <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>), the news feed on my dashboard has become fairly useless because activity is too fast and too much to really know what's happened while I was gone. So I wrote this little script to alert me in realtime about things happening.</p>
<p>Usage is simple:</p>
<pre><code>python path/to/githubfeed.py "url-to-private-feed"
</code></pre>
<p>The feed URL can be found at the top right on your dashboard, and the script should work automatically when you plug it in (given you have all dependencies in place; check out the source for that). I'll probably make a proper setup later.</p>
