					<title>Light Table</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>Interesting IDE concept, especially the 'smallest unit of code is a function' part. Now add Vim keybindings (because it's still the fastest way to move around text, regardless of what you say) and support for the most popular languages to this and we have something awesome.</p>]]></description>

					<title>Application Silos</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>The reason the Internet works is because it's interconnected. More than just hyperlinks pointing to things, websites can <em>talk</em> to each other and present context-specific information that they themselves don't necessarily contain, e.g. which of your friends like a website via. the Facebook "Like" button. Best of all, everything is distributed.</p>
<p>Why, then, do applications on our computers behave like silos?</p>
<p>Why doesn't my feed reader know my browser history (so that it can tell me if I've already read an article)? Why doesn't my browser know that I've already downloaded the file I'm trying to download now? Why doesn't my text editor know which email the document I'm currently editing was attached to?</p>
<p>The obvious way to solve this problem would be to do what we do on the web: allow individual applications to expose APIs that other applications can call to get more information. The not so obvious are things like avoiding duplication (something even the web struggles with, which if you've ever joined more than one social network, you've faced). But we could start small, like apps being able to query application specific information about things — like Reeder being able to ask Chrome if I've already visited the link pointed to by the article I'm reading.</p>
<p>I don't know, this seems like a problem we would have at least tried to solve, but I don't think OS' even support anything that might allow this. The most interoperability I've seen is registering application specific protocols so that when I open a <code>itunes://</code> link in Chrome, it opens in iTunes. I suppose it was cool in 2008, but four years later that's still all we have.</p>]]></description>

					<title>What Does a Music Conductor Do?</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>... [O]ne of the main things an orchestra conductor does is to prepare the orchestra in rehearsal for the way he/she wants the piece to sound in performance. A lot of stuff is conveyed in that way that the conductor then won't need to attempt to convey in real time during the performance. And furthermore, as you suspect, conductors are often in some sense kind of "dancing" for the audience during performances, in ways that are strictly superfluous to making the musicians play correctly, though sometimes an enjoyable part of the concert experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the musicians don't need much help keeping time, so the patterns are either heavily modified or abandoned entirely-although you can often see downbeats and things if you look for them. Second, orchestral conductors conduct WAY ahead of the beat the musicians are actually playing. This helps the musicians respond in real time to the conductor's instructions. From the audience's perspective, therefore, it can be nearly impossible to see the connection between what the conductor is doing and what you're hearing from the musicians-they're probably substantially out of sync.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered about the same thing, and I suppose kind-of knew that there is a lot less of realtime-ness in what a conductor does and more about the rehearsals. Once you practice everything hundreds of times, you don't really need someone guiding you.</p>]]></description>

					<title>Comics to Movies, and Back to Comics Again</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest Hollywood trend has been to take well-known and established comics and turn them into blockbuster summer flicks. In fact, that has been so successful that they've started doing the same for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">television serials</a> as well.</p>
<p>The upside to this is that comics are slowly but finally becoming mainstream, and getting the attention they should as an art-form. I know people who see a movie, realise it's based off a comic, then try to get their hands on the comic books and end up liking the latter more than the movie (quite like how book-based-movies work). Comics are just books, but visual. They're the bridge between books and movies, if you want to see the progression of story-telling. Books to comics to animated features to live-action movies. And I still look at comics as a "pure" art-form, undiluted and uncorrupted by capitalism and commercial agendas.</p>
<p>I must confess though that I'm not a big comic-book reader/collector. It's partly because I didn't have access to them as a child and partly because the allure of books, formal language and story-telling was far stronger than the more informal, leave-lesser-to-the-imagination nature of comic books. And yes, the moment you make something even remotely visual, you're taking away from the imagination of the reader.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that the movies being made are too mainstream and must-appeal-to-all-ages. Even Nolan's Batman franchise — gritty and dark as it is — has the family-movie feel to it. The real comic-to-movie successes (I think) are the ones that have flown under the radar: movies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(film)">Kick-Ass</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They aren't your family-trip kind of movies, but they're good movies nonetheless, and the comics are so much better. None of this High School Musical crap, but stories with real socipolitical commentary. These are the kind of comics that the mainstream will never see unless someone shows them.</p>
<p>But the good thing about being alive in the year 2012 is how easily available things are. Getting your hands on a comic is as simple as downloading an iPad app and then searching for your comic. As <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/comic-books-on-the-ipad">Jason Santa Maria rightly said</a>, comics have gained from having made the transition to the iPad. But I still don't think the size and nature of the screen is good enough to completely enjoy edge-to-edge illustrations. But hey, something is better than nothing.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Although the movie version of Kick-Ass was <em>seriously</em> toned down, and even then people had problems with it. The hypocrisy of our time is pretty much summed up in a single line from the movie's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(film)#Controversy">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christopher Mintz-Plasse expressed surprise that people were angry about the language, but did not seem to be offended that Hit-Girl kills many people.</p>
