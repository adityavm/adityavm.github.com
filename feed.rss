					<title>What Prometheus Was Really About</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>When I saw the movie for the first time, I had a feeling the movie wasn't as simple as it appeared.

					<title>The Alter Egos</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/j6oBbBfhgYE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Two lives are interesting, but not hard. Three lives, on the other hand, result in things like multiple personality disorders. There are times I do feel like I have MPD, but that story is for another time. To most people on the Internet I am the slightly cynical, slightly more misanthropic and opinionated designer. But as things go, even my MPD has MPD. My other Internet life goes by the alias "Painkiller", who is an avid gamer and equally opinionated, semi-raging 18 year old. I don't like to get these lives mixed up, so I don't talk about them in the realm <sup id="fnref:21-1"><a href="#fn:21-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of the other. But let's break that rule today.</p>
<h4>Welcome to the realm of terr-roar!</h4>
<p>The last three weeks have been pretty much University work, Diablo and sleep — in that order.</p>
<p>Diablo III is my first Diablo. In fact, it's my first dungeon crawler ever. I never saw the draw when I was younger, but I see it now. I got my hands on the game on the 16th of May, and since then I've MC'd a Monk to Inferno act 3. There are two others, but I prefer to play my Monk. Ranged classes have similar playstyles, "kite and DPS monsters off-screen" because if they catch you, you're dead. Monk hits a good middle ground between ranged classes and a Barb, with lesser staying power than a Barb and lesser DPS than a ranged class, but having just the right amounts of both. Being a melee class it's obviously very gear dependent, which is where most of my time has gone. Most of my gear is from the Auction House, I'll admit, but it's there to be used. I used it to speed the process up, but have stayed away from it since I got to Inferno.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/diablo">/r/Diablo</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo3Strategy">/r/Diablo3Strategy</a>, and while being on the Internet for as long as I have has taught me not to share opinions on Internet forums, I will say that people who just shut-up and play will fair a lot better than those who get into arguments. It sure worked for me. Like I said, I'm new to Diablo, but even I was able to get a Monk (arguably the hardest class to play right now) to act 3 <sup id="fnref:21-2"><a href="#fn:21-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Is the game hard? Yes. Does it take a while? Yes. Is it brainless grinding? No.</p>
<p>I'm definitely undergeared for act 3. Every molten or fire-chain pack wrecks me <sup id="fnref:21-3"><a href="#fn:21-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. But my skill build and some smart (I won't say skilled) play lets me move forward without a lot of hassle. And now with the <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/6262208/Patch_103_Design_Preview-6_6_2012">upcoming nerfs to act 2 and beyond</a>, it can only get easier. I think most people know only two ways of playing the game: DPS everything down before it reaches them or tank everything till it (or they themselves) dies. There is no middle ground in their book. These people need to play DotA/HoN and learn a few tricks. In that respect, I will say that Blizzard has done a really good job of making affixes useful. Molten/plagued monsters will stand in their puddle/run from you and make you take damage if you want to DPS them down. Fire-chained monsters will just single-mindedly run next to you letting the chain tick your health down instead of stopping to hit you which might give you a chance to reposition. It's frustrating, sure. But it's also fun. The AI isn't braindead, which is saying something.</p>
<p>My big Diablopiphany to take away is that skills become useful when you're undergeared. From that end, Inferno is balanced because you're <em>supposed</em> to be undergeared through most of it. When you're overgeared, all your skills become that much more effective so it doesn't matter how you use them. A Barb that can tank everything doesn't really need Revenge procs. A Monk that can hit fast enough with enough LoH to never lose health doesn't really need Serenity. These skills only come into play when your gear isn't up to snuff. So think about that along with your skill build and your playstyle, and change them around to suit the situation <sup id="fnref:21-4"><a href="#fn:21-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. This game is not braindead, stop playing it that way.</p>
<h4>Farewell old, deranged friend</h4>
<p>That's a good segue to my other wasn't-braindead-but-is-now game that I've now completely given up on — Heroes of Newerth. After close to two years of hoping S2 would get its act together, it's time to move on (read: hello DotA 2!). My reasons are the same as a lot of others who left — the gradual fading of the competitive scene, early-access and complete disregard for balance. Not in that order, sure, but each one is worse then the one before it.</p>
<p>It's painful to see all your favourite heroes lose viability one by one because of stupid decisions taken by the creators, and something you can't do anything about. The metagame makes heroes viable or unviable, and the balancers decide the metagame. One just needs to look at DotA 2 to see how multiple strategies can coexist and hence have no real metagame. Turtling strats can be countered with pushing strats. Hard-carry-farming strats can be countered with ganking/pushing strats. With HoN, there is always one (maybe two if we get lucky) dominant strategy that exists at a time. If you try and go against that, you're going to have a bad time. There are no two ways about it.</p>
<p>I never really understood why the community revered Icefrog the way it did, but now I do. He single handedly does what apparently 3-4 people over at S2 can't. I suppose some of that blame should be put on S2 as a whole as it let the competitive scene fade away into oblivion which had a big impact on balance, but it's hard to associate one failure with one cause; they're all mixed up together. Plus, now Valve is also showing us how in-game cosmetics are supposed to be done.</p>
<p>ARTS is a subgenre of RPGs in general. It was the most obvious thing, letting people customise their characters. But what we got in HoN was alt-avatars that everyone could buy and use. What's the fun (or draw) when you look exactly like the person next to you? Part of why Diablo is so much fun is because you can make your character look unique, even if your armour is exactly the same as someone else's (which has a very low chance anyway). Valve is definitely doing it right, not because it's Valve, but because it listens. S2 doesn't listen. At least, it doesn't listen anymore.</p>
<p>There is the key difference between normal tech-services and games-as-services, which is what all these online games have effectively become. Normal services shouldn't be community driven simply because people don't know what's best for them. But games <em>have</em> to be community driven because without us the game is worthless. Tech-services at least have the tech, if no customers. Games have nothing.</p>
<p>Now I'm just waiting for the official DotA 2 release, which is when I'm expecting the Mac version to release too. I've already stopped playing HoN— it's been a month now I think. And it might sound absurd, but I definitely feel like a better human being because of it. There's no sanity in constantly putting oneself in a situation of constant frustration. People quit jobs because of that. Games are nothing in comparison. So that's what I chose to do.</p>
<p>Now, my next thing to look out for is Episode 3 (you know what I'm talking about), and then I can probably die a happy man.</p>

					<title>The Problem With The Avengers</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>So Avengers Assemble was awful. I know no movie could live up to the hype, but it's like they didn't even try.</p>— Aditya Mukherjee (@aditya) <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya/status/197019721294548994" data-datetime="2012-04-30T17:48:56+00:00">April 30, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Few people have asked me over the last couple of weeks why I didn't like The Avengers. I've given them reasons that range from a lack of story to absolutely no relation between the heroes except for the fact that they're all in the movie trying to fend off one enemy. But even to myself, these reasons seem incomplete. I've liked movies like this before. So why didn't I like The Avengers? I think I've got it now.</p>
<p>The Avengers is as predictable and clichéd as a movie can get.</p>
<p>Right at the start, we're told Loki is going to attack Earth. And like clockwork, half an hour before the movie ends, he does. Obviously, we need some defence, and you get no prizes for guessing who that will be. After the customary five minutes of resistance, every hero gives in. You know the <em>whole</em> story in the first 10 minutes of the movie. All that's left to see and hear are the witty one-liners and things blowing up in 3D.</p>
<p>What really was a turn off was the lack of a significant new character. Agent Maria Hill was the randomest bit of eye candy I've seen, and I sincerely doubt The Avengers would've failed without the version of Clint Barton we saw in the movie. We even had the same enemy — Loki. The only <em>new</em> thing was the introduction of the Chitauri, but their worth was lost in the obscurity of being the generic war-mongering race of aliens that is the bane of Earth in every science fiction movie ever. It was like if Nolan made the three Batman movies with Ra's al Ghul as the antagonist. I doubt one would go for them thinking "Geez, I wonder what he's going to do this time?"</p>
<p>The least they could've done was introduce a new villain, like X-Men: First Class. That would have made the movie unpredictable in itself since a new villain would bring their own agenda (even if it ultimately led to the destruction of Earth) instead of rehashing a previously failed one. But instead of that, we got Transformers, but with humans instead of the robots.</p>]]></description>

					<title>Github Octicons</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p>These are absolutely gorgeous. Congratulations to Github on coming up with a rather interesting and <a href="https://github.com/blog/1135-the-making-of-octicons">well implemented</a> solution to their problem. With the state of displays being in flux as it is today, it makes sense to offload the rendering to the OS as much as possible, effectively future proofing another aspect of their website.</p>
<p>While this might not be a solution for most of us, it seems like the best way to distribute icons (and <a href="https://github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark">glyphs</a> in general) that scale well across all resolutions and sizes. Maybe we should start thinking differently about what constitutes a "font", and expand on how we use them beyond the alphanumeric symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Looks like I've been living under a rock. Turns out <a href="http://www.delicious.com/stacks/view/SC3hpq">Icon Fonts</a> are a real thing. Suddenly my epiphany doesn't seem so epiphanic.</p><p><a href='http://adityavm.github.com/post/github-octicons/' class='parmalink'>&#x2693;</a></p>]]></description>

					<title>Github Notifier</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I'm watching more repositories on Github than I'm following people on Twitter.What does that tell you?</p>— Aditya Mukherjee (@aditya) <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya/status/190033805782949888" data-datetime="2012-04-11T11:09:24+00:00">April 11, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I watch repositories in Github like I follow people on Twitter; I do it because I'm (very) interested in its present status and want to keep an out on its future development. I know most people use it like a bookmark for repos they want to come look at later, but I don't (I use <em>real</em> bookmarks for that).</p>
<p>But now that I've started watching a lot of repos (22, which includes beasts like <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>), the news feed on my dashboard has become fairly useless because activity is too fast and too much to really know what's happened while I was gone. So I wrote this little script to alert me in realtime about things happening.</p>
<p>Usage is simple:</p>
<pre><code>python path/to/githubfeed.py "url-to-private-feed"
</code></pre>
<p>The feed URL can be found at the top right on your dashboard, and the script should work automatically when you plug it in (given you have all dependencies in place; check out the source for that). I'll probably make a proper setup later.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adityavm/general/blob/master/githubfeed.py">Grab the Script.</a></p><p><a href='http://adityavm.github.com/post/github-notifier/' class='parmalink'>&#x2693;</a></p>]]></description>

					<title>E-mail: Don't Fix What's Not Broken</title>
					<description><![CDATA[<p><span class="disclaimer"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Commentary on the latest fad to get riled up about isn't my thing, but I wanted to elaborate on my <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya/status/191856633066958848">miniphany</a> <sup id="fnref:27-1"><a href="#fn:27-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Maybe it will lead to a better workflow for people who are looking for a solution to come to them rather than them solving it themselves.<span></p>
<p>I ran into <a href="http://joncalhoun.posterous.com/email-sucks-this-is-how-we-fix-it">this rant about e-mail</a> while link-jumping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is integrated with my email, yet it is my primary source of communication. What the hell? I shouldn't have to forward an email to accounting and then follow up to make sure they handled it. I shouldn't need to lookup the original email for a feature request - it should be integrated into the request itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I took it seriously is because he's actually taken the initiative and is <a href="http://www.roockit.com/">trying to solve the problem</a>. Although I do think it's a waste of his time because he has misunderstood the problem.</p>
<p>E-mail is probably a bad name for what it actually does when you look at the protocol used to implement it. It's got nothing to do with "mail" in the traditional sense. What e-mail is, is an extensible and powerful notification system. It's job is to ping you and alert you to something that needs your attention, then get out of your way. It's a different issue altogether that we use it for communication, because it's a carry over from the older web when the requirements of communication were simpler. For some reason, people like <a href="http://joncalhoun.posterous.com/email-sucks-this-is-how-we-fix-it">joncalhoun</a> and even <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">Paul Graham</a> have forgotten or misunderstood what e-mail was, in the sense that they want e-mail to <em>work</em> for them. It's like how someone got tweets to operate lights and fans in their house. It's the client's/application's problem, not the protocol's.</p>
<p>If you want issue tracking or calendaring, or even a to-do list, you go to an issue tracker, a calendar or a to-do list app. What e-mail does is notify you when something changes in those apps. It is up to <em>those</em> apps — not e-mail — to build the social stuff you're looking for. Github sends me an e-mail whenever someone adds an issue to my repositories, and I click through to manage it there. It doesn't make sense to have that functionality built into my e-mail client. If you don't use a dedicated issue-tracker for your bugs, you're doing it wrong. Could an e-mail client be written to handle different types of messages? Send a bug to your issue tracker, or send a to-do item to your to-do app? Sure. But that's not something that needs to be added to the protocol.</p>
<p>So here's the oft repeated statement, slightly tweaked: E-mail is not broken, your workflow is.</p>
