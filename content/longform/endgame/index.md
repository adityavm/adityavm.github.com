# Avengers: Endgame

_Spoilers alert_. One of the best things to come out of the previous decade was the MCU. I focus on the MCU above other movie
franchises because it has consistently delivered movies that are highly entertaining, visually stunning, and
with well-told and meaningful storylines. Endgame was a fitting end to a great of movies, stories, and
experiences.

If I'm to criticise it, because others will do a better job than me of raving about it, then my only complaint
would be how the writers allowed the story-rope to fray in their attempt to tie it up into satisfying little
knots to close out the loops. Stark should've been nowhere close to being capable of weilding the combined power
of the infinity stones. His contribution is through his intelligence and inventiveness, not strength of any kind.
Surely, technology alone — of any kind — is not capable of reducing the intensity of that power to levels low
enough that a normal man can not only weild it but also do _exactly_ what he wants. They passed over a literal
god (Thor), a human worthy enough to be considered a god (Rogers), another supercharged alien who single-handedly
took out a whole Kree fleet (Danvers), and the new sorcerer supreme and the strongest of their kind (Strange)<sup>1</sup>.

However, that being the only unsatisfactory thing in the whole movie is a testament to how good it was. Given
the scope, number of characters, various settings, storyline … there were any number of ways it could have failed,
but it delivered in every one of those aspects. That, is a perfect representation of the whole MCU till date,
and can be easily forgiven because it's only a mistake in the face of Infinity War and how brilliant it was.

1. Of course, it can be argued that it did end up killing him so that proves that he was _not_ strong enough, but
  surely Stark can't be compared to any of the others in strength, whatever kind it may be.
