		<p>Interesting look at villainy. Could also be a justification-in-disguise of why Curtis went from calling himself a "superhero" to a "villain". Personally, his definition of a villain is what I would call an anti-hero. Villains are defined as people who cause damage and harm to people and things around them. It's not about hurting a few to save many; that's as selfish a reason as doing something just because you want to. Nothing a villain does is for the good of those around him, not in the long or short run. So maybe Curtis should start calling himself a symbol, rather than a superhero or a villain. Allying himself to either side seems counter-logical.</p>
<p>Of course, since he brings up the Batman reference, I should also point out the Joker who was a villain not out of some personal "ego, greed, lust, or the desire for power", but because as Alfred put it, "Some men just want to watch the world burn."</p>
