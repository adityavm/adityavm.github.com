		<blockquote>
<p>... [O]ne of the main things an orchestra conductor does is to prepare the orchestra in rehearsal for the way he/she wants the piece to sound in performance. A lot of stuff is conveyed in that way that the conductor then won't need to attempt to convey in real time during the performance. And furthermore, as you suspect, conductors are often in some sense kind of "dancing" for the audience during performances, in ways that are strictly superfluous to making the musicians play correctly, though sometimes an enjoyable part of the concert experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the musicians don't need much help keeping time, so the patterns are either heavily modified or abandoned entirely-although you can often see downbeats and things if you look for them. Second, orchestral conductors conduct WAY ahead of the beat the musicians are actually playing. This helps the musicians respond in real time to the conductor's instructions. From the audience's perspective, therefore, it can be nearly impossible to see the connection between what the conductor is doing and what you're hearing from the musicians-they're probably substantially out of sync.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered about the same thing, and I suppose kind-of knew that there is a lot less of realtime-ness in what a conductor does and more about the rehearsals. Once you practice everything hundreds of times, you don't really need someone guiding you.</p>
