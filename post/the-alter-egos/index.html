<p>Two lives are interesting, but not hard. Three lives, on the other hand, result in things like multiple personality disorders. There are times I do feel like I have MPD, but that story is for another time. To most people on the Internet I am the slightly cynical, slightly more misanthropic and opinionated designer. But as things go, even my MPD has MPD. My other Internet life goes by the alias "Painkiller", who is an avid gamer and equally opinionated, semi-raging 18 year old. I don't like to get these lives mixed up, so I don't talk about them in the realm <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of the other. But let's break that rule today.</p>
<h4>Welcome to the realm of terr-roar!</h4>
<p>The last three weeks have been pretty much University work, Diablo and sleep — in that order.</p>
<p>Diablo III is my first Diablo. In fact, it's my first dungeon crawler ever. I never saw the draw when I was younger, but I see it now. I got my hands on the game on the 16th of May, and since then I've MC'd a Monk to inferno act 3. There are two others, but I prefer to play my Monk. Ranged classes have similar playstyles, "kite and DPS monsters off-screen" because if they catch you, you're dead. Monk hits a good middle ground between ranged classes and a Barb, with lesser staying power than a Barb and less DPS than a ranged class but having just the right amounts of both. But being a melee class it's obviously very gear dependent, which is where most of my time has gone. Most of my gear is from the Auction House, I'll admit, but it's there to be used.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/diablo">/r/Diablo</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo3Strategy">/r/Diablo3Strategy</a>, and while being on the Internet for as long as I have has taught me not to share opinions on Internet forums, I will say that people who just shut-up and play will fair a lot better than those who get into arguments. It sure worked for me. Like I said, I'm new to Diablo, but even I was able to get a Monk (arguably the hardest class to play right now) to act 3 <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Is the game hard? Yes. Does it take a while? Yes. Is it brainless grinding? No.</p>
<p>I'm definitely undergeared for act 3. Every molten or fire-chain pack wrecks me <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. But my skill build and some smart (I won't say skilled) play lets me move forward without a lot of hassle. And now with the <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/6262208/Patch_103_Design_Preview-6_6_2012">upcoming nerfs to act 2 and beyond</a>, it can only get easier. I think most peeople know only two ways of playing the game: DPS everything down before it reaches them or tank everything till it (or they themselves) dies. There is no middle ground in their book. These people need to play DotA/HoN and learn a few tricks. In that respect, I will say that Blizzard has done a really good job of making affixes useful. Molten/plagued monsters will stand in their puddle/run from you and make you take damage if you want to DPS them down. Fire-chained monsters will just single-mindedly run next to you letting the chain tick your health down instead of stopping and hitting you which might give you a chance to reposition. It's frustrating, sure. But it's also fun. The AI isn't braindead, which is saying something.</p>
<p>My big Diablopiphany to take away is that skills become useful when you're undergeared. From that end, Inferno is balanced because you're <em>supposed</em> to be undergeared through most of it. When you're overgeared, all your skills become that much more effective so it doesn't matter how you use them. A Barb that can tank everything doesn't really need Revenge procs. A Monk that can hit fast enough with enough LoH to never lose health doesn't really need Serenity. These skills only come into play when your gear isn't up to snuff. So think about your skill build and change them around to suit the situation <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. This game is not braindead, stop playing it that way.</p>
<h4>Farewell old, deranged friend</h4>
<p>That's a good segue to my other wasn't-braindead-but-is-now game that I've now completely given up on — Heroes of Newerth. After close to two years of hoping S2 would get its act together, it's time to move on (read: hello DotA 2!). My reasons are the same as a lot of others who left — the gradual fading of the competitive scene, early-access and complete disregard for balance. Not in that order, sure, but each one is worse then the one before it.</p>
<p>It's painful to see all your favourite heroes lose viability one by one because of stupid decisions taken by the creators, and something you can't do anything about. The metagame makes heroes viable or unviable, and the balancers decide the metagame. One just needs to look at DotA 2 to see how multiple strategies can coexist and hence have no real metagame. Turtling strats can be countered with pushing strats. Hard-carry-farming strats can be countered with ganking/pushing strats. With HoN, there is always one (maybe two if we get lucky) dominant strategy that exists at a time. If you try and go against that, you're going to have a bad time. There are no two ways about it.</p>
<p>I never really understood why the community revered Icefrog the way it did, but now I do. He single handedly does what apparently 3-4 people over at S2 can't. I suppose some of that blame should be put on S2 as a whole as it let the competitive scene fade away into oblivion which had a big impact on balance, but it's hard to associate one failure with one cause; they're all mixed up together. Plus, now Valve is also showing us how in-game cosmetics are supposed to be done.</p>
<p>ARTS is a subgenre of RPGs in general. It was the most obvious thing, letting people customise their characters. But what we got in HoN was alt-avatars that everyone could buy and use. What's the fun (or draw) when you look exactly like the person next to you? Part of why Diablo is so much fun is because you can make your character look unique, even if your armour is exactly the same as someone else's (which has a very low chance anyway). Valve is definitely doing it right, not because it's Valve, but because it listens. S2 doesn't listen. At least, it doesn't listen anymore.</p>
<p>There is the key difference between normal tech-services and games-as-services, which is what all these online games have effectively become. Normal services shouldn't be community driven simply because people don't know what's best for them. But games <em>have</em> to be community driven because without us the game is worthless. Tech-services at least have the tech, if no customers. Games have nothing.</p>
<p>Now I'm just waiting for the official DotA 2 release, which is when I'm expecting the Mac version to release too. I've already stopped playing HoN— it's been a month now I think. And it might sound absurd, but I definitely feel like a better human being because of it. There's no sanity in constantly putting oneself in a situation of constant frustration. People quit jobs because of that. Games are nothing in comparison. So that's what I chose to do.</p>
<p>Now, my next thing to look out for is Episode 3 (you know what I'm talking about), and then I can probably die a happy man.</p>

<p>It's hard not to use that word when you hear it every 2 minutes for 3 weeks in a row.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I'm not going to get into the story, because that's pretty subjective. No, I'm not saying anything. Really.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3">
<p>Interestingly, those are the only two affixes I can't fight. I've almost developed a mental block against them. Every other affix is a piece of cake, but the moment I see fire chains I think about restarting my quest.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>For example, playing Inferno act 2 onwards without Dashing Strike is just suicide. Period. Breath of Heaven really drops off too. If you depend on these skills like BoH, you're pigeonhole-ing yourself into a defensive build that will never be able to solo effectively.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
