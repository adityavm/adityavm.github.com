		<p>The latest Hollywood trend has been to take well-known and established comics and turn them into blockbuster summer flicks. In fact, that has been so successful that they've started doing the same for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">television serials</a> as well.</p>
<p>The upside to this is that comics are slowly but finally becoming mainstream, and getting the attention they should as an art-form. I know people who see a movie, realise it's based off a comic, then try to get their hands on the comic books and end up liking the latter more than the movie (quite like how book-based-movies work). Comics are just books, but visual. They're the bridge between books and movies, if you want to see the progression of story-telling. Books to comics to animated features to live-action movies. And I still look at comics as a "pure" art-form, undiluted and uncorrupted by capitalism and commercial agendas.</p>
<p>I must confess though that I'm not a big comic-book reader/collector. It's partly because I didn't have access to them as a child and partly because the allure of books, formal language and story-telling was far stronger than the more informal, leave-lesser-to-the-imagination nature of comic books. And yes, the moment you make something even remotely visual, you're taking away from the imagination of the reader.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that the movies being made are too mainstream and must-appeal-to-all-ages. Even Nolan's Batman franchise — gritty and dark as it is — has the family-movie feel to it. The real comic-to-movie successes (I think) are the ones that have flown under the radar: movies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(film)">Kick-Ass</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They aren't your family-trip kind of movies, but they're good movies nonetheless, and the comics are so much better. None of this High School Musical crap, but stories with real socipolitical commentary. These are the kind of comics that the mainstream will never see unless someone shows them.</p>
<p>But the good thing about being alive in the year 2012 is how easily available things are. Getting your hands on a comic is as simple as downloading an iPad app and then searching for your comic. As <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/comic-books-on-the-ipad">Jason Santa Maria rightly said</a>, comics have gained from having made the transition to the iPad. But I still don't think the size and nature of the screen is good enough to completely enjoy edge-to-edge illustrations. But hey, something is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Although the movie version of Kick-Ass was <em>seriously</em> toned down, and even then people had problems with it. The hypocrisy of our time is pretty much summed up in a single line from the movie's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(film)#Controversy">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christopher Mintz-Plasse expressed surprise that people were angry about the language, but did not seem to be offended that Hit-Girl kills many people.</p>
