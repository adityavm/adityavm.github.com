Writing posts in Wordpress irks me like few other things do. I've figured that half the reason why I don't write/post/publish/whatever as frequently as I would like to is because the mere thought of having to look at Wordpress' admin panel annoys me. So today I found [Speechhub][sh], and after [modifying it a little][sh2], I have my new Shorts-like blog up on Github.

It's pretty basic, but that's the idea. I've taken the concept behind [Svbtle][dc] as a spiritual guide to how I will approach blogging, and we'll see where it goes. And of course, I'll be fixing up how this place looks as time goes on.
