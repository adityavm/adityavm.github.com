I watch repositories in Github like I follow people on Twitter; I do it because I'm (very) interested in its present status and want to keep an out on its future development. I know most people use it like a bookmark for repos they want to come look at later, but I don't (I use *real* bookmarks for that).

But now that I've started watching a lot of repos (22, which includes beasts like [Bootstrap][gh]), the news feed on my dashboard has become fairly useless because activity is too fast and too much to really know what's happened while I was gone. So I wrote this little script to alert me in realtime about things happening.

[gh]: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap

Usage is simple:

	python path/to/github.py "url-to-private-feed"

The feed URL can be found at the top right on your dashboard, and the script should work automatically when you plug it in (given you have all dependencies in place; check out the source for that). I'll probably make a proper setup later.
